# 1. Project Goal
This project endeavors to meet the increasing demand for practical applications in the realm of computer systems by developing a chat system based on socket communication. The goal is to provide a tangible and well-documented learning resource for students and developers, emphasizing fundamental principles in concurrent programming, network protocols, and user authentication within a real-world context. The basic functionality of the project involves establishing secure communication channels through sockets, facilitating multi-user chat interactions, and ensuring a seamless user experience through effective error handling and, if applicable, an intuitive graphical user interface.
# 2. System Description
